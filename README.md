### About

Eatin is a web application where users can create and join groups and go on a local adventure. After the group decides a central location, the app will give the group a challenge. the challenge will choose a random food to eat and a random city within a chosen radius (with directions). The group then has 24 hours to complete the challenge before it vanishes!

### Planned Updates

Groups will be able to see previously completed challenges

Group members will be able to attach photos to a challenge

Open to suggestions :)
